#How git generates commit messages.
It uses Hash values to generate commit Ids (SHA-1 algorithm).
One commit has reference to previous commit id if you change even commit message.

#HEAD
A pointer that points to current commit id in the  current branch.
HEAD pointer points to current commit.
HEAD : ref: refs/heads/{master}|{branch_name}

#Untracked files:
Files that git knows nothing about.

#multiline commits
Just do not use -m option ,it will new editor file 
where you can add multiline commit message.

#Amend command only amends most recent commit.
where you can add multiline commit message.
