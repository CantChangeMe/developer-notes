1. Devtools dependency works only when automatic build is on in IDE(i.e. Eclipse)
2.When using profile there are two ways in which you can use property files from different ENV
i.e.
application.properties
application-test.properties
application-dev.properties
application-prod.properties

  2.1 Either you access them using @Value annotation or 
  2.2 You define a component with @ConfigurationProperties annotation.And autowire this bean wherever you want.This approach seems better.
