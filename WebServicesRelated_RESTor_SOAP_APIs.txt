Status Code Definitions

<pre>
1.Informational 1xx
This class of status code indicates a provisional response, consisting only of the Status-Line and optional headers, and is terminated by an empty line. There are no required headers for this class of status code. Since HTTP/1.0 did not define any 1xx status codes, servers MUST NOT send a 1xx response to an HTTP/1.0 client except under experimental conditions.
A client MUST be prepared to accept one or more 1xx status responses prior to a regular response, even if the client does not expect a 100 (Continue) status message. Unexpected 1xx status responses MAY be ignored by a user agent.
</pre>
<pre>
2. Successful 2xx
This class of status code indicates that the client's request was successfully received, understood, and accepted.

200 OK
201 Created
202 Accepted
The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed.
The request might or might not eventually be acted upon, as it might be disallowed when processing actually takes place.
There is no facility for re-sending a status code from an asynchronous operation such as this.

Response status codes beginning with the digit "5" indicate cases in which 
the server is aware that it has erred or is incapable of performing the request

500 Internal Server Error
The server encountered an unexpected condition which prevented it from fulfilling the request.

501 Not Implemented
The server does not support the functionality required to fulfill the request. This is the appropriate response when the server does not recognize the request method and is not capable of supporting it for any resource.

502 Bad Gateway
The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid response from the upstream server it accessed in attempting to fulfill the request.

503 Service Unavailable
The server is currently unable to handle the request due to a temporary overloading or maintenance of the server.

504 Gateway Timeout
The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, did not receive a timely response from the upstream server specified by the URI (e.g. HTTP, FTP, LDAP) or
some other auxiliary server (e.g. DNS) it needed to access in attempting to complete the request.
